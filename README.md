# My-Value-Shopper-Frontend

My My-Value-Shopper-Frontend is a front end (client) SPA (single page application) that integrates with My-Value-Shopper-Backend(server).
My Value Shopper with the help of a Rapid API interface allows users to enter a 10 character Amazon ID number (ASIN). There is authentication that allows the user to sign up or log in. Once an item has been returned via a fetch request to the Rapid API site, that data is populated in the application and stored on the back end. Data includes a title, description, images, price history, quantity available and a link to that item on Amazon.com.
